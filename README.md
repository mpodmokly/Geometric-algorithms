# Geometric-algorithms
## Projects
* Lab 1 - testing the orientation of an ordered triplet
of points.
* Lab 2 - finding the convex hull using Graham's scam
Algorithm and Jarvis' Algorithm (Wrapping).
* Lab 3 - finding the triangulation of an y-monotonic polygon.
* Lab 4 - finding all line segments intersections using sweep line algorithm.

## Algorithm implementations
1. Graham's scam Algorithm - finds a convex hull in $O(nlogn)$ time
2. Jarvis' Algorithm (Wrapping) - finds a convex hull in $O(kn)$ time
where $k$ is number of hull points,
3. Triangulation of an y-monotonic polygon in $O(n)$ time
