## Projects
* Lab 1 - testing the orientation of an ordered triplet
of points.
* Lab 2 - finding the convex hull using Graham's scam
Algorithm and Jarvis' Algorithm (Wrapping)

## Algorithm implementations
1. Graham's scam Algorithm - finds a convex hull in $O(nlogn)$ time
2. Jarvis' Algorithm (Wrapping) - finds a convex hull in $O(kn)$ time,
where $k$ is number of hull points
